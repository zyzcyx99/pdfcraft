        "uploaded": {
          "question": "Are my files uploaded to a server?",
          "answer": "No, your files are never uploaded to any server. All PDF processing happens locally in your browser using JavaScript and WebAssembly. Your files never leave your device."

          "question": "Is it safe to use PDFCraft with sensitive documents?",

          "question": "What happens to my files after processing?",
          "answer": "Your files are stored temporarily in your browser's memory during processing. Once you close the browser tab or navigate away, all file data is automatically cleared. We don't store any of your files."

        },

          "question": "Can I merge multiple PDF files?",

        },
        "slow": {
          "question": "Why is processing slow for large files?",
          "answer": "Since all processing happens in your browser, performance depends on your device's capabilities. Large files require more memory and processing power. For best results, close other browser tabs and applications."
        },
        "offline": {
          "question": "Does PDFCraft work offline?",
          "answer": "Currently, PDFCraft requires an internet connection to load the application. However, once loaded, the PDF processing itself happens locally and doesn't require a connection."
