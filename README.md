## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.17 or later
- npm, yarn, or pnpm

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PDFCraftTool/pdfcraft.git
    cd pdfcraft
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```

4.  **Open your browser**
    Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application running.

### Docker Compose

If you prefer running PDFCraft in containers, you can use the provided `docker-compose.yml`.

#### Development (Next.js dev server)

```bash
docker compose --profile dev up
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

#### Static export + Nginx (production-like)

This runs `next build` to generate the static export (`out/`), then serves it via Nginx using `nginx.conf`.

```bash
docker compose --profile prod up --build
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

To stop and remove containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## 📜 Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server with Turbopack.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
- `npm run start`: Starts the production server.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the code using ESLint.
- `npm run test`: Runs tests using Vitest.

## 🚀 Production Deployment Guide

PDFCraft is configured for static export (`output: 'export'`), which means it can be deployed to any service that supports static website hosting without requiring a Node.js server.

### 1. Build Project

Before deploying, build the project to generate static files using the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

After the build is complete, all static files will be located in the `out` directory.

### 2. Deployment Options

You can deploy the contents of the `out` directory to any of the following platforms:

#### A. Vercel (Recommended)
1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Run the `vercel` command.
3. Follow the prompts to set the build command to `npm run build` and the output directory to `out`.
4. Alternatively, connect directly to your GitHub repository, and Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and configure it.

#### B. Nginx / Apache
Copy the contents of the `out` directory to the root directory of your web server.

**Nginx Configuration Example:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    root /path/to/your/pdfcraft/out;
    index index.html;

    # Handle static files
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri.html $uri/ =404;
    }

    # Enable gzip compression
    gzip on;
    gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript;
}
```

#### C. GitHub Pages
1. Push the `out` directory to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository.
2. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings.
3. Note: If you are not using a custom domain, you might need to modify `basePath` in `next.config.js`.

#### D. Netlify
1. Connect your repository to Netlify.
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set publish directory: `out`

### 3. Important Notes
- **Headers Configuration**: The `headers` configuration in `next.config.js` does not automatically take effect in static export mode. You need to configure HTTP headers separately depending on your hosting platform (e.g., `vercel.json` for Vercel or Nginx configuration).
- **Image Optimization**: Since static export does not support Next.js's default image optimization server, the project is configured with `images: { unoptimized: true }`.

### 4. Verify Deployment
After deployment, please check the following features to ensure everything is working correctly:
- Multi-language routing (e.g., `/en`, `/zh`)
- Tool page loading
- WebAssembly (PDF processing) functionality
